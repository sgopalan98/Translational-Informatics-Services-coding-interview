# Translational Informatics Services coding interview

## Section 1
For this series of questions, please use genotypes.txt and phenotypes.txt from Assignment/Section 1 directory.
1) Define data values found in genotypes.txt? What does the data represent?
2) From genotypes.txt, for each variant (eg: rs#_1 and rs#_2), merge alleles into genotype calls. Save file as genotype_merged.txt.
3) Identify the number of female (Gender = 0) patients under the age of 60 that have type II diabetes (cases = 1), and plot a distribution of the genotypes for each variant. Save the plots as genotype_plots.png.
4) How many male (Gender = 1) patients over the age of 35, and with a BMI in the 3rd quartile have at least one missing genotype?
5) Save file you used to answer questions 3 and 4 as section1.csv.
