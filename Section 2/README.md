# Translational Informatics Services coding interview

## Section 2
For this series of questions, please use TIS_raw_input1.txt and TIS_raw_input2_regulation_status.txt from Assignment/Section 2 directory.
1) Allow workflow to be run using workflow_runner.py.
2) Enable execution of workflow to occur using the function run() from within workflow_runner.py.
3) Implement [quantile normalization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_normalization#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20quantile%20normalization%20is,and%20sort%20the%20reference%20distribution) on the given dataset. The quantile normalization process should ensure that the distribution of the gene expression values is consistent across samples. Save the normalized data matrix as a tab-delimited text file named qnorm.txt 
4) Generate a [violin plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot) to visualize the distribution of gene ‘expression7’ across different regulation statuses. Save violin plot as violin_plot.png
