## Question 1: 

### **File content overview**:

The 'genotypes.txt' file contains genetic data for a group of individuals.

- Each row represents the genetic information of one person.
- Columns stand for specific genetic markers or differences.

The data indicates how gene variants are paired at these markers for each person.

### **Column explanations**:

- '#IID': This is a unique ID for each person.
- Columns like RS#_1 and RS#_2 (e.g., rs1421085_1, rs1421085_2) hold a person's genetic code at a particular spot in their DNA.
- _1 and _2 show two versions (Alleles) of the gene at that spot.


### **Value explanations**:

- '#IID's are  basically random unique numbers generated during surveys for individuals. Ex: 1534210213 might be a random unique number for an individual
- rs#_1/rs#_2 columns contain one of the 4 neucleotides that are found in DNA - Guanine(G), cytosine(C), adenine(A), and thymine(T)
