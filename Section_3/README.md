## Section 3
For this series of questions, please use session_3_assignment.py from Assignment/Section 3 directory.
1) Convert section_3_assignment.py into a function that returns a data frame. Start with a data frame that is 10 rows by 4 columns. The first 3 columns must be random integers between 0 and 100, while the 4th column must contain 50% 'female' and 50% 'male' values.
2) Melt df on the forth column, and then sort the data. Filter results so that you only return results from Column 1 and for males.
3) What was the maximum value for the first column in df? What was the minimum value for the second column in df? What was the maximum value for the second column in df?
4) Save output as df.csv
